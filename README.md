# Telnet Extend Lib (TEL)
This is a set of simple Telnet tool kits, now supporting only few rfcs (RFC857,
RFC858, RFC1091, RFC1073). However, that is adequate for applying an ASCII
Animation site or a small BBS. Here are some examples:
Still Alive:    telnet://dynascii.tarcadia.site:6023
Bad Apple:      telnet://dynascii.tarcadia.site:6024

# Prototype.BNYYCS
This is the prototype of this project. The detail of the prototype can be found
in branch "prototype" and issue #1. This prototype development is now closed.
